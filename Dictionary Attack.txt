What is a Dictionary Attack?
A dictionary attack is a type of password cracking method used by hackers to gain unauthorized access to an account or system.

How It Works:
The attacker uses a predefined list of words — often common passwords, phrases, or words from the dictionary.

The list is called a "dictionary file", hence the name.

The attack script tries each word in the list one by one until it finds the correct password or exhausts all options.

Example:
Let’s say someone’s password is:
nginx
Copy
Edit
iloveyou123

A typical dictionary file might include:
python-repl
Copy
Edit
password
123456
qwerty
admin
iloveyou
welcome
dragon



If iloveyou123 or even just iloveyou is on the list, the attacker has a good chance of breaking into the account quickly.

	Why Is This Attack Dangerous?
Many people use weak or common passwords, making dictionary attacks very effective.

Unlike brute-force (which tries every possible combination), a dictionary attack is faster because it uses likely guesses.

	How to Defend Against It:
Use long, complex passwords that don’t include common words or names.

Include symbols, numbers, and uppercase/lowercase letters.

Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

Use a password manager to generate strong random passwords.

Example of a Secure Password (not vulnerable to dictionary attack):
shell
Copy

Jk#91$eA!bQ@4Zx
 
 This password is:
Not a dictionary word
Long and random
Includes symbols, numbers, and mixed case
