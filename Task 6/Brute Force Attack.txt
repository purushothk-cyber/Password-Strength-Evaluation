Types Of Brute Force Attacks
There are various types of brute force attack methods that allow attackers to gain unauthorized access and steal user data.

	Simple brute force attacks:

A simple brute force attack occurs when a hacker attempts to guess a user’s login credentials manually without using any software. This is typically through standard password combinations or personal identification number (PIN) codes. 

These attacks are simple because many people still use weak passwords, such as "password123" or "1234," or practice poor password etiquette, such as using the same password for multiple websites. Passwords can also be guessed by hackers that do minimal reconnaissance work to crack an individual's potential password, such as the name of their favorite sports team.

	Dictionary attacks:

A dictionary attack is a basic form of brute force hacking in which the attacker selects a target, then tests possible passwords against that individual’s username. The attack method itself is not technically considered a brute force attack, but it can play an important role in a bad actor’s password-cracking process. 

The name "dictionary attack" comes from hackers running through dictionaries and amending words with special characters and numbers. This type of attack is typically time-consuming and has a low chance of success compared to newer, more effective attack methods.

	Hybrid brute force attacks:
A hybrid brute force attack is when a hacker combines a dictionary attack method with a simple brute force attack. It begins with the hacker knowing a username, then carrying out a dictionary attack and simple brute force methods to discover an account login combination. 

The attacker starts with a list of potential words, then experiments with character, letter, and number combinations to find the correct password. This approach allows hackers to discover passwords that combine common or popular words with numbers, years, or random characters, such as "SanDiego123" or "Rover2020."

	Reverse brute force attacks:
A reverse brute force attack sees an attacker begin the process with a known password, which is typically discovered through a network breach. They use that password to search for a matching login credential using lists of millions of usernames. Attackers may also use a commonly used weak password, such as "Password123," to search through a database of usernames for a match.
