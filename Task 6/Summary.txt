Importance of Symbols, Length, and Character Mix

	A strong password is:

Long (at least 12+ characters)

Complex, using a combination of:

Uppercase letters (A-Z)

Lowercase letters (a-z)

Numbers (0–9)

Symbols (!, @, #, $, %, etc.)

These elements increase entropy (randomness), making brute-force and dictionary attacks much harder.

	Use of Passphrases
A passphrase is a long sentence or phrase made of random or meaningful words.

Example: Red$Tiger!Runs@Fast2025

	Benefits:

Easy to remember

Very hard to crack

Can include symbols and numbers for added complexity

	Avoid Common Patterns
Avoid:

Dictionary words like apple, admin, god

Common passwords like 123456, qwerty, password

Personal info (name, DOB, mobile number)

Simple patterns (e.g., aaaa1111, abcd1234)

These are easily guessed or cracked using automated tools in seconds.

	Quick Tips for Creating Strong Passwords
✅ Minimum 12–16 characters

✅ Mix of upper, lower, digits, and symbols

✅ Avoid repetition and patterns

✅ Don’t reuse old passwords

✅ Use MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) wherever possible
